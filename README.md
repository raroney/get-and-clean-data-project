# get-and-clean-data-project

The [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/raroney/get-and-clean-data-project/blob/master/run_analysis.R) script included in this repository was created for the Project within the coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data (by Jeff Leek, PhD, Roger D. Peng, PhD, Brian Caffo, PhD). The specific link for my cohort / course session: https://class.coursera.org/getdata-031/)

The data that this script was written to analyse can be downloaded from here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The data was originally obtained from here:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The [Code Book](https://github.com/raroney/get-and-clean-data-project/blob/master/CodeBook.md) for this project describes:

* The source _UCI HAR Dataset_ and the way it has been used
* The usage and behaviour of the `run_analysis.R` script 
* The data set generated by using the `run_analysis.R` script

To get started quickly (without following the detailed procedure), make sure you have RStudio with the `dplyr` package installed, download the [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/raroney/get-and-clean-data-project/blob/master/run_analysis.R) script into your favourite R working directory, download and unzip the [UCI HAR Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) into the same place, and run the commands:

```
> summary.data <- run_analysis()
> View(summary.data)
```
